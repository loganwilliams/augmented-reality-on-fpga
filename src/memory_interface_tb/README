test plan

tb1.v - runs the interface for 2000 cycles to see if the blocks, locs, vga_addr,
 and ntsc_addr are instantiated properly, midway, it pulses frame_flag, and ob-
serves whether blocks, locs are updated properly. - written and tested

tb2.v - feeds a set of (x,y) coordinates from LPF and PT and observes whether 
they are parsed correctly, based on their locs and blocks - written and tested

dummy_zbt.v - a very simple recreation of a ZBT SRAM module - written
dummy_zbt_tb.v - testing of the dummy_zbt.v module - written and tested

tb3.v - testing of queueing with only NTSC and VGA - written and tested

tb4.v - first, real test: frame_flag pulses, causing capt and next_disp to be
on the same block. ntsc writes 2 cycles after done_ntsc pulses. pt writes 3 
cycles after done_pt pulses. ntsc writes the sequence 1:1:1000; pt writes the
sequence 10000:-1:9000. frame_flag pulses, vga reads pt's sequence. frame_flag
 pulses again and vga reads ntsc's sequence.


What is memory_interface supposed to do?
- shift the locations and blocks of the different images when reset or frame_flag pulses
- correctly parse LPF and PT addresses based on (x,y) coords
- correctly reset NTSC and VGA addresses and increment them when ntsc_capture and vga_write request pixels
- assign read outputs of both memory modules to modules who requested reads two cycles ago (queueing)
- prioritize NTSC and VGA over PT and LPF (NTSC and VGA will never overlap)
- pass on processed requests to the memory modules, correctly setting the wr, addr, and write signals of each mem module
- pulse done to respective module when its request has been processed
